# Fake News Detection Project

## Overview
This repository contains a fake news detection project that aims to differentiate between real and fake news using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Python and leverages natural language processing for text analysis.

## Project Details
- **Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset consisting of labeled fake and true news articles.
- **Preprocessing:** The text data is preprocessed to remove noise and transform it into a format suitable for machine learning.
- **Feature Extraction:** The TF-IDF vectorization technique is used to extract features from the text data.
- **Model:** A Naive Bayes classifier is trained to predict whether a news article is real or fake.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
